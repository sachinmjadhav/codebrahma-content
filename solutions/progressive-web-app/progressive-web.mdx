### Why Progressive Web Applications ?
While there are thousands of apps on the Apple App Store and even more on the Google Play Store. Numbers show that 60% of Apps have never been downloaded or used.

The App Store and the Play Store also cause major problems for developers who must work carefully to avoid breaking the rules. The App Store is also a not great for SEO (search engine optimization), because listings are largely excluded from Google search results. Progressive Web Apps circumvent the App Store , allowing users to find your Apps with normal URLs and Google search.

### What is the future of Progressive Web applications ?
