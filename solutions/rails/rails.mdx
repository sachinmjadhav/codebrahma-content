## Our Ruby on Rails Projects

## Here are some of the best features of Ruby on Rails

## Rapid Development
50,000 gems to choose from. Gems are modular software packages that we can reuse. Common functionality like User Management, Social feeds etc are available as gems for us to reuse

## Robust Framework
Rails has one of the most vibrant open source communities which has evolved the framework over the last ten years into one of the most robust frameworks out there. RSpec, Capybara and other testing tools help us to build robust applications as well.

## Standards
Rails follows convention like REST , MVC which make your codebase fairly regularised. This helps you expand your team without acquiring technical debt.
